## Installation 

App is deployed to Heroku. No installation required. 

## Usage 

Link to web application: https://calm-savannah-54938.herokuapp.com/ 

Our site if free for anyone to browse. However, if you would like to participate in a room or have your own profile on the site, you will be required to create an account for the site.

Once you are logged in, you may access your profile page through "My Profile". You are able to edit every single piece of information on your profile, including first name, last name, age, gender, description, interests, and a profile image. Unfortunately, the site currently doesn't support password changes, but we plan to implement that in the future.

In order to reply messages in any room, simply join the room and you may send messages. 

You can create and edit a room from your dashboard. After room creation, you will have to manually join the room you just created in order to participate in the romm activities. However, we do plan to automate that process in the future.

The website will log all users out one hour after signing to ensure account security, so don't be worried when you get logged out after wandering on the site for a while. 

## Future Development

As you may see, this is a minimum viable product, and does not fully delivery the purpose of our project. To improve the site, we would need to work on the features below: 

- **Friending Feature**: Allow users to becomes friends with each other and display user's friends on their profile page.
- **Filter Search by Interest**: Adding interest categories to rooms and implementing a search filter on interest categories. When an interest category is checked, search results should display all rooms and users that included that interest category.
- **Delete Message**: Allow users to delete and edit messages they sent in rooms. 
- **Better Error Preventtion**: Show proper warnings and ask for confirmations when a user attempts for an irreversible action, such as deleting a user/room/message from the database. 
- **Notifications**: Send notifications to users when new messages are sent in a room they have joined.
